# AST_project_MVA

This is a report for the Time Series project of the MVA course. The objective of the
project is to provide the key concepts in order to follow our presentation during the
student seminar of the Times Series course. We will explain the key concepts of
the article [1], the different steps of our implementations and explain the way we
tried to contest the conclusions of the article. We will show that the method Durka
used to prove that ARIMA is better than ARIMAX is flawed, and provide another
comparison of the two methods. The code can be found on github at this link [2]
